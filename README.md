### How It Works

1. **Hover Interaction**:  
   When you move your cursor over any data point on the chart, a tooltip appears showing the specific date and relevant data associated with that point. This provides an easy way to explore the data without needing to click or navigate away.

2. **Smooth Animations**:  
   The chart features smooth animations when loading and when interacting with the data points. These animations make the experience more engaging, offering a professional and polished look to the chart.

3. **Responsive Design**:  
   The chart is fully responsive, adjusting seamlessly to different screen sizes. Whether viewed on desktop, tablet, or mobile, the chart remains clear and functional, ensuring a consistent user experience.

4. **Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**:  
   The project leverages HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, making it lightweight and easily customizable. The code is modular, allowing for easy modifications or the addition of new features.
